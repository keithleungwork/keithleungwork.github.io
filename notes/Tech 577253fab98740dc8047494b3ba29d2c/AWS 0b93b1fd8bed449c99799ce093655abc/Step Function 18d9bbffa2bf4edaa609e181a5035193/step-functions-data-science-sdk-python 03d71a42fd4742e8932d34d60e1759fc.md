## Quick Fact:

> Step Functions creates workflows out of steps called [States](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-states.html), and expresses that workflow in the [Amazon States Language](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-amazon-states-language.html). 
When you create a workflow in the AWS Step Functions Data Science SDK, it creates a State Machine representing your workflow and steps in AWS Step Functions.
