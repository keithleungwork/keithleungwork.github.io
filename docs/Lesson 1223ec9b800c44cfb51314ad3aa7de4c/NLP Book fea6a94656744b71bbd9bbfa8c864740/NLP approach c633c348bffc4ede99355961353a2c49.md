## Heuristics-based Methods

- i.e. Rule-based approach
- e.g. Count how many positive & negative words to judge a sentiment of the text.
- using `Wordnet` - db of words, and semantic relationships between them
- using regex (i.e. `StandfordCoreNLP` , `TokensRegex`, `Pregex`)
- Context-Free-Grammar (CFG) - a formal grammar to model natural lang
    - Earley Parser
    - JAPE (Java Annotation Patterns Engine)
- Rule based system -  General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE)

## Machine Learning Methods

- Classification
    - `Naive Bayes` - classic algorithm for classification tasks
    - `Support Vector Machine(SVM)` - learn a decision boundary to classify classes
- Regression
- `Hidden Markov Model` - a statistical mdoel
    - used for POS tagging
- `Conditional Random Field(CRF)`
    - POS tagging
