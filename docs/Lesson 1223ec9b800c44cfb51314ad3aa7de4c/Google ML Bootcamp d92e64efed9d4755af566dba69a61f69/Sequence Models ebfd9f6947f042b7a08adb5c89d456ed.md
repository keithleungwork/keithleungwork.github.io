## Week 1

### Assignment 1

**RNN Architecture:**

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are very effective for Natural Language Processing and other sequence tasks because they have "memory.‚Äù
- The example of RNN with len(input) = len(output)

    - Each input $x^{(t)}$can be an one-hot vector, or just a value. 
    e.g. A language with a 5000-word vocabulary could be one-hot encoded into a vector that has 5000 units. So¬†$x^{(t)}$¬†shape = (5000,)
    - The activation¬†a‚ü®t‚ü©¬†that is passed to the RNN from one time step to another is called a `hidden state`
    

**RNN Cell:**

- Think of the recurrent neural network as the repeated use of a single cell
- The following figure describes the operations for a single time step of an RNN cell:

**LSTM Cell:**

- An LSTM is similar to an RNN in that they both use hidden states to pass along information, but an LSTM also uses a cell state, which is like a long-term memory, to help deal with the issue of vanishing gradients
- An LSTM cell consists of a cell state, or long-term memory, a hidden state, or short-term memory
- Here is the cell detail:

- The simple explanation of the flow through:
    - Similar to simple RNN, `a(t-1)` and `x(t)` are the inputs (near the bottom left)
    They are used to calculate:
        - Forget Gate - A ‚Äúmask‚Äù vector, used for another input `c(t-1)` calculation, between 0~1
        - Update Gate - A ‚Äúmask‚Äù vector, that decides if the Candidate values `ùêúÃÉ¬†‚ü®ùë°‚ü©` can pass into the hidden state `c(t)` , between 0~1
        - Candidate value - the value calculated from previous activation and current input, between -1~1
        - Output Gate - A ‚Äúmask‚Äù vector, decides what values are passed into Output y, and next activation
    - `c(t-1)` is another new input here (left side)
        - With the Forget Gate from above, values are decided to whether pass in or not
        - Then add with the final candidate value, it become the next `c(t)`

- About the `Forget Gate`:

- About the `Candidate Value`

- `Update gate` :

- `Output gate`:

- At last, final `cell state`

- `Hidden state` for next cell

**Generating text:**

- After the language model is trained, we can use it to generate pieces of text
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-12-27 at 17.59.03.png](Sequence%20Models%20ebfd9f6947f042b7a08adb5c89d456ed/Screen_Shot_2022-12-27_at_17.59.03.png)
    
    - The `sample` process here is to : sampling a random text in the chosen texts, to prevent generating the same text every time.
        - How to: With the output of softmax, we have a vector of probability. Then we choose the words by taking its probability. 
        E.g. word at i-th index = 16%, it might be picked with a chance of 16%
