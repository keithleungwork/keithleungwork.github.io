## Course 1 - ****Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification****

Types of algorithm :

- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Recommender systems
- Reinforcement learning

### Supervised Learning :

- Right answers(data) given
- e.g. Online Ads platform - Input your data and the ad → output the probability of you clicking it.

Support Vector machine

- There is a mathematical trick to allow computer to deal with infinite number of features

Regression Problem

- Trying to predict a **continuous** (Non-discrete) valued output

Classification Problem

- **Discrete** valued output

### Unsupervised learning :

- Given only the data without label.
- The goal is to find some pattern, structure, or anything interesting about the data.

Clustering algorithm

- Similar to classification BUT it just does clustering data into groups the model found.
- i.e. We don’t know what are the different types, we let the model find it out
- e.g. Google news clustering the news and provide related/similar news recommendation
- e.g. DNA gene clustering, different group of DNA people may have similar behavior
- e.g. Cluster customers into groups for easier & efficient marketing
- e.g. [Deeplearning.ai](http://Deeplearning.ai) cluster their community users, to know the purpose of users why joining courses, subscribing newsletters, attending events…etc

Anomaly Detection

- Fraud detection in finance industry

Dimensionality Reduction

- Take a large dataset and reduce it into a smaller dataset
- e.g. file compression
