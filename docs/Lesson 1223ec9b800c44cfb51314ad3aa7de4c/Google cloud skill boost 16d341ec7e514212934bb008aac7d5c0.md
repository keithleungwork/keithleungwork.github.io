## **How Google Does Machine Learning**

Notes:

Backward-looking data = look at historical data
ML = make predictive decision base on data

Google translate:

- e.g. take photo of a sign to translate
- 1 model to find the sign
- 1 to read the sign
- OCR
- 1 to detect the language
- 1 to translate the sign
- 1 to superimposed translated text
- maybe 1 to select the font style now using

Google search :

- few years ago logic:
    - a bunch of hand-coded rules, e.g. your location + query text => which result to show
- NOW:
    - DL
    - RankBrain - a DL network for search ranking
    - WHen you click on a link, it may tell google: this result is what you wanted from the query text
    

ML can solve: anything you are writing rules today

throw away the heuristics just as soon as you have enough data about user preferences

To frame a ML problem

- As an ML problem:
    - what is being predicted
    - what data do we need
- As a software problem:
    - What does the API look like
    - what is the input & output
    - Who will use this service
    - how others are doing this today
- As a data problem:
    - what kind of data we need to collect
    - What to analyze
    - How to react to the prediction
