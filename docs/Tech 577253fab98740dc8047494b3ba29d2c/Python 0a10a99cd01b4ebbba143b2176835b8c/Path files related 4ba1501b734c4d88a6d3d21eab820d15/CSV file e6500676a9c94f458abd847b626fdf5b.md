# CSV file

> You can read CSV directly with numpy, pandas, or native csv module, which depends on the usage

## Native module: `csv`

- Useful if wanna read row by row

### By csv.reader

- Read each row as list

```python
from csv import reader

path = "some.csv"

# open file in read mode
with open(path, 'r') as read_obj:
    # pass the file object to reader() to get the reader object
    csv_reader = reader(read_obj)
    header = next(csv_reader)
    print(header)
    # Check file as empty
    if header != None:
        # Iterate over each row in the csv using reader object
        for row in csv_reader:
            # row variable is a list that represents a row in csv
            print(row)
```

### By csv.DictReader

- Read each row as a dict, with the csv header as dict keys

```python
from csv import DictReader

path = "some.csv"

# open file in read mode
with open(path, 'r') as read_obj:
    # pass the file object to DictReader() to get the DictReader object
    csv_dict_reader = DictReader(read_obj)
    # iterate over each line as a ordered dictionary
    for row in csv_dict_reader:
        # row variable is a dictionary that represents a row in csv
        print(row)
```

## By Pandas

- Good if the subsequent tasks are Panads involved
- [https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html)

```python
import pandas as pd

pd.read_csv('data.csv')
```

---

## By numpy

- Not common
- because difficult to set each field type
- [https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.io.genfromtxt.html?highlight=csv](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.io.genfromtxt.html?highlight=csv)

```python
from numpy import genfromtxt
my_data = genfromtxt('my_file.csv', delimiter=',')
```
