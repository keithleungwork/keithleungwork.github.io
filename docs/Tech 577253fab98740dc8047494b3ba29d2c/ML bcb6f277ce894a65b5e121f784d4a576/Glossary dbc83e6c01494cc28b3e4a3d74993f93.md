## Maths :

### Euclidean Distance

- Pronounce: “yu cly di an”
- Distance between 2 points

### Pythagorean theorem

- Pronounce: “py tha gor ri an”
- a^2 + b^2 = c^2

## Statistic :

### Gaussian Distribution (a.k.a. Normal Distribution)

### orthogonal

- We say that 2 vectors are orthogonal **if they are perpendicular to each other**
. i.e. the dot product of the two vectors is zero.

### Variance

- variance measures the average degree to which each point differs from the mean.

- Note the diff:
    - **Variance is the average squared deviations from the mean, while standard deviation is the square root of this number**
    

### Sample with *replacement*

- It means the sample drawn will be put back to the pool before next drawn
- i.e. multiple drawn is independent of each others

### **Stochastic**

- Stochastic refers to the property of being well described by a random probability distribution.
- Although stochasticity and randomness are distinct in that the former refers to a modeling approach and the latter refers to phenomena themselves
- But two terms are often used synonymously.
- ~= Random

### Squared residual

- a.k.a.  Residual sum of squares,  sum of squared residuals, sum of squared estimate of errors
- It is the sum of the squares of residuals. It is a measure of the discrepancy between the data and an estimation model

## Machine Learning

### Regularizations

- Regularization is a technique that helps overcoming over-fitting problem in machine learning models. It is called Regularization as it helps keeping the parameters regular or normal
- e.g. the L2 regularization in Ridge Regression

### Variance

- Note: not the variance in statistic

- i.e. high variance = overfit
