# Metrics

## Basic terms

- Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
    - For all positive predicted, how many of them are correct.
    - i.e. How many hit you missed
- Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
    - How many positive is predicted among ALL ground true positive
    - i.e. How many REAL target you hit
    

## Mean Absolute Error(MAE) :

To put it in short, take the absolute value of below error

```python
error=actualâˆ’predicted
```
