# Semi-supervised learning

## What is it ?

It involves a *small number of **labeled** examples* and *a large number of **unlabeled** examples*.
This situation is challenging for either supervised or unsupervised learning to be effective.
And this learning algorithm sits between supervised and unsupervised learning.
 

These algorithms can perform well when we have a very small amount of labeled points and a large amount of unlabeled points.
