# scikit-learn

---

It is a popular framework for 

- its rich content,
- wide selection of model algorithms,
- unified API coding style

---

## **Preprocessing :**

### train_test_split :

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# without random_state = 0, the split will be random every time
train_X, val_X, train_y, val_y = train_test_split(X, y, random_state = 0)
```

---

## Models **:**

Record the algorithm Iâ€™ve used or seen.

### Example of unified API :

```python
# import the algorithm you want
# Only this line varies by the model you choose
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

# From here are all similar
model = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=0)

# Train
model.fit(X,y)

# Predict
predictions = model.predict(test_data)
```

## **Metrics :**

- i.e. `from sklearn.metrics import xxxx`

### mean_absolute_error :

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

pred = model.predict(X)
mean_absolute_error(y, pred)
```
