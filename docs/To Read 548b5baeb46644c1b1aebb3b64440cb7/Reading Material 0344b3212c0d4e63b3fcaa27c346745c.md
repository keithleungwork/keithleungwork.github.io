- ***Recommended*** - kaggle course
    - [https://www.kaggle.com/learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn)
    - Text course, reading friendly
    - E.g. ML, python
    - Can get certificate
- ***Recommended*** - Dive into Deep learning - [https://d2l.ai/index.html](https://d2l.ai/index.html)
    - Super great interactive DL book with notebbok
- Scikit learn
    - Its user guide is too complex. But is a very great outline of algorithm that you should learn. Just use it as a target list.
- Tensorflow - [https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials)
    - Tensorflow training sample by using fashion MNiST.
        - [https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification)
    - Strategy to prevent overfit or underfit
        - [https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/overfit_and_underfit#strategies_to_prevent_overfitting](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/overfit_and_underfit#strategies_to_prevent_overfitting)
    - Optimize dataset for training
        - [https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/text_classification#configure_the_dataset_for_performance](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/text_classification#configure_the_dataset_for_performance)
        - .cache - avoid store all data in memory, also faster than loadjng millions of small files
        - .prefetch - allow to do preprocess while training at the same time.

## Video Lesson / Course

- Full Stack Deep Learning Youtube channel
    - [https://www.travelwith.jp/roadtraveler/post-62256/](https://www.travelwith.jp/roadtraveler/post-62256/)
- Codecademy - provide many project-wise lesson path, can build up portfolio seamlessly
    - [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/master-statistics-with-python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/master-statistics-with-python)
- Fastai
    - Course, not the framework
    - It's approach is from top level and learn practical first
- Deeplearning ai
    - Opposite from fastai, start from low level like Maths, and then gradually deep dive to Tensorflow
- PyTorch youtube
    - [https://www.youtube.com/c/PyTorch](https://www.youtube.com/c/PyTorch)
