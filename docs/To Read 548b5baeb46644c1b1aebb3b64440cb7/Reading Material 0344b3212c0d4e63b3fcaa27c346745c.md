# Tutorial / Doc

- A guy called Jason Brownlee PhD, made a detailed path guide to learn
    - [https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/#getstarted](https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/#getstarted)
    - PS: this platform `bnomial` always quote this blog
- Scikit-learn
    - Follow all guide here, they cover a lot of useful & practical skills, e.g. PCA
    - [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html)
- Tensorflow
    - Tensorflow training sample by using fashion MNiST.
        - [https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification)
    - Strategy to prevent overfit or underfit
        - [https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/overfit_and_underfit#strategies_to_prevent_overfitting](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/overfit_and_underfit#strategies_to_prevent_overfitting)
    - Optimize dataset for training
        - [https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/text_classification#configure_the_dataset_for_performance](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/text_classification#configure_the_dataset_for_performance)
        - .cache - avoid store all data in memory, also faster than loadjng millions of small files
        - .prefetch - allow to do preprocess while training at the same time.
