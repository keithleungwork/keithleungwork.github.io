# Solution

- ~~Exporting into HTML seems better~~
    - ~~No need jekyll at all…~~
    - ~~But cannot control anything, e.g. style, common header…etc, nothing~~
- Exporting manually to md & script to fix links problem
    - Need to do manually
    - Make script to search links and replace
        - Easy way:
            - Get all md file names,
            - Search in all md for these file names, replace as decoded string (e.g. %20 → space)
        - ~~use custom plugin like this [https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-relative-links/blob/main/lib/jekyll-relative-links/generator.rb](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-relative-links/blob/main/lib/jekyll-relative-links/generator.rb)~~
- ~~Exporting via API programmatically~~
    - ~~Official API cannot do export~~
    - ~~can try this~~
